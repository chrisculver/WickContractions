Wick Contractions
=================

This code is a work in progress, and is expanding beyond just a repository
for performing wick contractions.  Functionality will be added to make it more
like http://github.com/chrisculver/CorrelationMatrixManager, which only works
for mesons.  This code base should work for any object composed of quarks.
