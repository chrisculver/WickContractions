Wick Contractions
=================

This code applies Wick's theorem to correlation functions containing quark fields.  
This code is largely meant to be used with something like `PyCorrelationMatrixManager <https://github.com/chrisculver/PyCorrelationMatrixManager>`_,
but has also been used to study hadron structure via `4PointFunctions <https://github.com/chrisculver/4PointFunctions>`_.
